# Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention & Modeling Project

## Description
Lead poisoning can cause irreversible neurological damage in children. Lead in drinking water or paint are typical sources of lead poisoning. Currently, public health focuses response after children test for elevated lead levels. But we may be able to get ahead of the curve by using machine learning models. More information on childhood lead poisoning prevention can be found at the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/overview.html). 

For this project, we focused on New York data from the health.data.ny.gov site. In New York, health care providers are required to test all children for lead at or around ages one and two years. 

**Focus**: Machine learning models to identify children at risk for lead poisoning.

# Grading Info
## Requirements
1. Data Model Implementation (25 points)
* A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)
* The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points)
* The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)
* The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)
